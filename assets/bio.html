            <h1>Full stack developer</h1>
            <p>
              My experience as developer is in its beginnings. I worked on group projects and individual assigments during my boot camp. I also worked in personal projects while working on my boot camp asisgments although, working on homework was very extensive and time consuming task. My previous experience with computers is related to using: Microsoft suite (Word, Excell, Power Point, Access, Note, forms, etc.). I also know how to manipulate 3-D printers and software desing such as: Sketchup, Blender and Cura*.

            <h1>Previous Experience</h1>
            <p>
             I studied Education at Universty of Guadalajara in Mexico. I was a teacher for 12 years. During this time, I learned that developing authentic ideas, having a smooth transition between activities and planning for possible troubles is the key to success. I found an interesting corelation between teaching and coding using these same principles. During my teaching face, I found myself programming 3D designs while teaching a 3D workshop in one of my classes.
